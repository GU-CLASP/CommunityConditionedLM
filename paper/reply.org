- On Novelty
  - We are surprised that some reviewers insist that our paper should
    improve the state of the art in general language modelling. It
    does not, but this is not where are contribution lies. Instead we
    are interested in the capability of well-known models to capture
    socially meaningful relationships between communities.

    We have clarified this point in the introduction. (JP: DONE) We
    believe that the references given in the related work section also
    made this clear.
    
  - On the use of LSTM (JP: DONE)
    - We use it because it works better than the Transformer
    - We believe that this is because the Transformer requires larger
      dataset and more parameters to reach peak performance. 
    We have proposed this explanation in the text.

- On methodology 
  - (JP: DONE) The discussion of particular subreddits is meant as an
    illustration to help understanding the analyses. This discussion
    is necessarily anectodal, but not constitutive of our results. We
    have clarified this in the text.
    
  -  We added statistics on language (English/non-English) and explained
     our rationale for not attempting to filter the data by language.
     (TODO: line numbers)

- On downstream tasks
  - We consider our socio-lingustic task be applicative and relevant. It is
    our impression that relevance to downstream tasks is not relevant
    for this piece of work.

- On clarity of conclusion:
  - Reviewer iNiE states: "you should try to provide some quantitative
    analysis, to base your qualitative observations on." This is
    exactly what we do (TODO: line numbers)
  - The reviewer also complains about the clarity of a 4-sigma
    deviation from null hypothesis. This is a very standard and in our
    opinion clear way to express the significance of results. We'd
    like to request a more clear description of the suspected
    unclarity here.

- On availability the dataset: (Bill)
  - For ethical and legal reasons (GDPR, reddit terms of service) we
    cannot provide a curated subset of messages from Reddit, however
    our submitted code includes scripts to extract the data from
    pushshift.io, and will be made available upon publication
    (clarified in the text)
  - We will provide the produced community embeddings (clarified in
    the text).

- We have made sure to thoroughly proofread our paper.

- References to add: (Bill)
  - Community identity and user engagement in a multi-community landscape 
    (defines two notions of community distinctiveness: token type and
    word sense based; relates to community membership features)
  - Characterizing English Variation across Social Media Communities 
    with BERT (2021 TACL paper)
  - Computational Sociolinguistics: A Survey (add to introduction; make focus 
    of our paper more clear in relation to this survey)
