- On Novelty
  - We are surprised that some reviewers insist that our paper should
    improve the state of the art in general language modelling. It
    does not, but this is not where are contribution lies. Instead we
    are interested in the capability of well-known models to capture
    socially meaningful relationships between communities.

    We have clarified this point in the introduction. (JP: DONE) We
    believe that the references given in the related work section also
    made this clear.
    
  - On the use of LSTM (JP: DONE)
    - We use it because it works better than the Transformer
    - We believe that this is because the Transformer requires larger
      dataset to reach peak performance. It also needs more parameters to do so.
    We have proposed this explanation in the text.

- On methodology (Bill)
  - The discussion of particular subreddits is meant as an
    illustration to help understanding the analyses. This discussion
    is necessarily anectodal, but not constitutive of our results. We
    have clarified this in the text.
    
  - The inclusion of non-english subreddits seems to be a sticking point
    for some reviewers. We modified the paper to point out the following:
     - There is no clear distiniction between English/Non-English subreddits.
       Indeed, English is used in the "non-english" subreddits and most of the
       "english" subreddits have posts in other languages as well.
     - The amount of non-english data is marginal (about 2% of the data)
       and does not qualitatively influence the results.
    If reviewers feel very strongly about it, we can exclude communities
    with >X% non-english text, for a value of X provided by the
    reviewers.

- On downstream tasks
  - We consider our socio-lingustic task be applicative and relevant. It is
    our impression that relevance to downstream tasks is not relevant
    for this piece of work.

- On clarity of conclusion:
  - Reviewer iNiE states: "you should try to provide some quantitative
    analysis, to base your qualitative observations on." This is
    exactly what we do (TODO: line numbers)
  - The reviewer also complains about the clarity of a 4-sigma
    deviation from null hypothesis. This is a very standard and in our
    opinion clear way to express the significance of results. We'd
    like to request a more clear description of the suspected
    unclarity here.

- On availability the dataset: (Bill)
  - For ethical and legal reasons (GDPR, reddit terms of service) we
    cannot provide a curated subset of messages from Reddit.
  - We will provide the code to extract the data upon publication
    (clarified in the text)
  - We will provide the produced community embeddings (clarified in
    the text).

- We have made sure that a native thoroughly proofread our paper.
