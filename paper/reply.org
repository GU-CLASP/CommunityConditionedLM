We would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. 
Below we give a detailed response to issues that were raised 
and indicate changes that were made to the paper.

- On Novelty
  - We are surprised that some reviewers insist that our paper should
    improve the state of the art in general language modelling. It
    does not, but this is not where are contribution lies. Instead we
    are interested in the capability of well-known models to capture
    socially meaningful relationships between communities.

    We have clarified this point in the introduction.  We
    believe that the references given in the related work section also
    make this clear.
    
  - On the use of the LSTM 
    - We use it because it works better than the Transformer
    - We believe that this is because the Transformer requires larger
      dataset and more parameters to reach peak performance. 
    We have proposed this explanation in the text (207--216).

- On methodology 
  - The discussion of particular subreddits is meant as an
    illustration to help understanding the analyses. This discussion
    is necessarily anectodal, but not constitutive of our results. We
    have clarified this in the text (279--283).
    
  -  We added statistics on language (English/non-English) and explained
     our rationale for not attempting to filter the data by language.
     (113--120; 625--647)

- On downstream tasks
  - We consider our socio-lingustic task be applicative and relevant. It is
    our impression that relevance to downstream tasks is not of immediate
    concern for this piece of work, but we have added a reference to previous 
    work in this area (546--551)

- On clarity of conclusion:
  - Reviewer iNiE states: "you should try to provide some quantitative
    analysis, to base your qualitative observations on." This is
    exactly what we do (284--195)
  - The reviewer also complains about the clarity of a 4-sigma
    deviation from null hypothesis (374--390 and 458--478 in the 
    previous draft, 387-- and 470 in this draft). 
    This is a very standard and in our
    opinion clear way to express the significance of results. We'd
    like to request a more clear description of the suspected
    unclarity here. 
  - The social embedding is described on lines 250--261. A more 
    detailed explanation can be found in Kumar et al. (2018).

- On availability the dataset: 
  - For ethical and legal reasons (GDPR, reddit terms of service) we
    cannot provide a curated subset of messages from Reddit, however
    our submitted code includes scripts to extract the data from
    pushshift.io, and will be made available upon publication
    (clarified in the text)
  - We will provide the produced community embeddings (clarified in
    the text).

- We have made sure to thoroughly proofread our paper.
