\section{Community-level results} \label{sec:community-level-results}

The following table shows results at the community level. The baseline $\Ppl_{M_j}$ 
is computed from the unconditioned LSTM and the CCLM results ($\Ppl_{M_j}$, $\IG_{M_j}$,
and $\Ind_{M_j}$ use the LSTM with $l_c=1$). ``Social cluster'' is determined by 
k-means clustering of the social embedding.
