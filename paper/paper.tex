\title{Community-Conditioned Language Models}

\section{Introduction}

We propose to test the following hypotheses:

 - Different communities have different levels of linguistic complexity
 - different language models are able to recognize such differences
 - level at which the community embedding is taken into account in the language model influences this.
 - community vectors are correlated with extra-linguistic information.
 - stability is correlated with language complexity

 \section{Experimental setup}
 \section{Results and analysis}
 
- Computation of loss/community/model (show all)
- Computation of confusion matrix for community inference per model (eg. show only best and worst model) (on test set)
- Computation of H(c,m) entropy of community identification (on test set)
- Correlation between H(c,m) for various models. Identification of specific communities by hand
- Correlation between H(c,m) and Stability(c).

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

- Comparison with topic modelling
